#[Landlab](http://landlab.github.io) Tutorial



This Gist contains the following files:

- an unexpanded iPython notebook
- an expanded iPython notebook
- the code
- the data (if applicable)

To run the iPython notebook, copy this Gist to your local working environment (use download or fork/clone, whichever is most familiar to you).

From the command line in your terminal, navigate into your new directory.

Use the command ``$ ipython notebook`` to open the iPython notebook viewer locally in your browser. Navigate to the ``.ipynb`` file you want to run and click to open it.

To run a code cell in the notebook, type ``shift`` ``enter``. The order in which you run the cells matters. You can even experiment with typing your own code into the cells.
