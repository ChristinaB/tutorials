    "This tutorial demonstrates implementation of the Cellular Automaton Tree-GRass-Shrub Simulator (CATGRaSS) [Zhou et al., 2013] on a digital elevation model (DEM). This model is built using components from the Landlab component library. CATGRaSS is a spatially explicit model of plant coexistence. It simulates local ecohydrologic dynamics (soil moisture, transpiration, biomass) and spatial evolution of tree, grass, and shrub Plant Functional Types (PFT) driven by rainfall and solar radiation. \n",

Establishment of plants in empty cells is determined probabilistically based on water stress for each PFT. Plants with lower water stress have higher probability of establishment. Plant mortality is simulated probabilistically as a result of aging and drought stress. Fires and grazing will be added to this model soon.  \n",
