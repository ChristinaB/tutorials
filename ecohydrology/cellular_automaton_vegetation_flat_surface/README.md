#[Landlab](http://landlab.github.io) Tutorial

This tutorial contains the following files:

- an unexpanded iPython notebook
- an expanded iPython notebook
- the code
- the data (if applicable)

The unexpanded iPython notebook can be run interactively as a code-along. If you don't want to run the notebook interactively, the expanded iPython notebook can be read as a text tutorial.

To run the iPython notebook, copy the [Landlab tutorial repo](https://github.com/landlab/tutorials) to your local working environment (use the download button or fork/clone, whichever is most familiar to you).

From the command line in your terminal, navigate into your new directory.

Use the command ``$ ipython notebook`` to launch the iPython notebook viewer (it will open locally in your browser). Then navigate to the ``.ipynb`` tutorial you want to run and click to open it.

To run the notebook, place your cursor in a code cell and type ``shift`` ``enter``. The order in which you run the cells matters. You can even experiment with typing your own code into the cell and running that.
