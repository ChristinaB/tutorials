#[Landlab](http://landlab.github.io) Tutorial

This tutorial contains the following files:

- an unexpanded iPython notebook
- an expanded iPython notebook
- the code
- the data (if applicable)

The unexpanded iPython notebook can be run interactively as a code-along. If you don't want to run the notebook interactively, the expanded iPython notebook can be read as a text tutorial.

To run the iPython notebook, either copy the [Landlab tutorial repo](https://github.com/landlab/tutorials) to your local working environment (use the ``Download ZIP`` button or fork/clone, whichever is most familiar to you) or download each notebook individually from [http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/landlab/tutorials](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/landlab/tutorials) using the download button (upper right in each notebook).

Then, from the command line in your terminal, navigate into your new directory (or the directory that contains your download).

Use the command ``$ ipython notebook`` to launch the iPython notebook viewer (it will open locally in your browser). Then navigate to the ``.ipynb`` tutorial you want to run and click to open it.

To run the notebook, place your cursor in a code cell and type ``shift`` ``enter``. The order in which you run the cells matters. You can even experiment with typing your own code into the cell and running that.
