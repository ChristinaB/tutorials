    "## Components versus Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Landlab components are designed to serve as the building blocks for numerical models, but a Landlab component is not a model by itself. Rather, a component-based Landlab model would consist of a *driver program* that instantiates and runs one or more components. For this reason, a Landlab component will not normally create or contain another component (though there are occasional exceptions that prove the rule; for example, a `FlowAccumulator` can create a `FlowDirector`). Instead, if one component relies on output from another component, the recommended practice is to have the relevant output field from one component act as an input field for another. For example, a component that generates a spatial rainfall pattern would have the rainfall as an output field; a runoff-generation component might then require a rainfall field as an input."

    "## Required and Recommended Elements for Components\n",
    "\n",
    "A Landlab component must:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Derive from the Component base class\n",
    "* Provide the standard header information (such as `input_var_names`)\n",
    "* Provide an `__init__` method. If the component uses a Landlab grid, a Landlab grid object should be the first argument (after `self`). Any other necessary parameters should be given as keyword arguments with meaningful defaults.\n",
    "* Provide a `run_one_step` method. This method should either have no arguments other than `self`, or have a single additional argument that represents the duration of the step.\n",
    "* Include external and internal documentation. If the component is included in the Landlab package (as opposed to being a separate add-on), it needs to have an entry in the API Reference Manual at landlab.readthedocs.org. The component code should include a header docstring that briefly describes what it is, and lists its input parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these basic ingredients, we highly recommend that Landlab components also include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A docstring for each function. Docstrings should ideally include (1) a one-line description of what the component does, starting with a verb (e.g., \"Update fields with current loading conditions\"); (2) a list of parameters with their data types, units (if applicable), and a brief description; (3) data returned (if any); (4) one or more doctests; and (5) any relevant notes that will help your future self (or others) understand how the function works.\n",
    "* Unit tests. These can be implemented either as built-in doctests, or as external tests, or both. \n",
    "* Tutorial(s). A Jupyter Notebook is a great way to illustrate how a component can be used. Notebooks that contain tutorials about various Landlab components are in the [tutorials](https://github.com/landlab/tutorials) repository. Ideally, every component should have an accompanying tutorial (though as of this writing we have not yet reached that goal).\n",
    "* Public and private variables. Class variables that are not meant to be seen or modified by users should ideally be flagged as private by adding a leading underscore to the variable name. Those that don't are considered public, and should be handled as described below.\n",

    "## Unit Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing is essential to writing robust scientific software. A typical Landlab component includes two types of test: doctests and external tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doctests, in addition to testing a particular piece of code, should also give users an idea of how the code works---in other words, it should function both as a test, and as an example of how to use the functionality in question. Docstrings, including doctests, are scraped automatically to create content in the [Landlab API Reference Manual](https://landlab.readthedocs.io).\n",
    "\n",
    "External testing scripts normally live in a subdirectory called `tests` inside your component's main folder, in a file called `test_`(something)`.py`, with one or more functions whose names begin with `test_`. Using this naming convention makes it easy for testing tools to find and run your tests. The `numpy.testing` module provides handy functions for testing, such as asserting that the values in a particular array match the values that you expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your component is part of the Landlab codebase (and not an external plugin), its tests will be run automatically whenever a pull request is made. But you might also want to run the tests locally while you are developing your component. There are a variety of tools to do this. As of this writing, the Landlab Development Team uses the `pytest` utility, together with the `coverage` extension that calculates which lines of code are and are not covered by at least one test. An example of the command-line syntax to run tests is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pytest --doctest-modules --cov-report term-missing --cov=.`\n",
    "\n",
    "This example usage tells pytest to run doctests as well as external tests, to examine the coverage of any files in the current directory or its subdirectories, and to display a report listing the coverage in each file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best practice is to have your component 100% tested, meaning that every line gets run at least once."

    "## Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Landlab component ideally has three kinds of documentation: internal documentation using docstrings within the code, \"external\" documentation in the [Landlab API Reference Manual](https://landlab.readthedocs.io), and one or more tutorials in the [tutorials](https://github.com/landlab/tutorials) repository. Internal and external documentation are essentially one and the same: the internal docstrings are read and formatted (\"scraped\") to produce the API Reference documentation for each component. To get a component's docstrings included in the API Reference, you simply need to create a short text file in Landlab's `docs` folder, and edit the `index.rst` file in the same folder to add a reference to your new file. The process is described in the User Guide section on [Developing Your Own Component](https://github.com/landlab/landlab/wiki/Develop-your-own-component)."

    "## Coding Tips and Tricks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Avoid Hard-Coding Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be tempting to include hard numbers in your code, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "`grav_force = 9.81 * mass`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two disadvantages to this approach. An obvious one is that a user who wants to change the hard number is forced to edit the code (what if you want to run your model for Mars?). Another disadvantage is that the hard numbers are buried deep in the code, and might not be documented. Yet a third potential problem is that the hard-wired numbers may have units, and therefore rely on the assumption that any other inputs and variables have compatible units. And finally, your hardwired numbers may lack sufficient precision for a user's application (e.g., is gravitational acceleration 10.0 or 9.8 or 9.81?).\n",
    "\n",
    "A better option is to have these numbers be user-determined inputs with built-in default values. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class MyCoolComponent(Component):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    def __init__(self, grid, grav_accel=9.8):\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If for some reason this is not a practical option---for example, if the numerical value in question is truly a constant---then a good practice is to use \"syntactic sugar\": define a variable in ALLCAPS near the head of the file in question. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "GRAV_CONSTANT = 6.67408e-11  # near head of file\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "grav_force = GRAV_CONSTANT * (mass1 * mass2 / distance**2)  # somewhere deep in the code\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Field Names\n",
    "\n",
    "Landlab field names should be reasonably descriptive, while not being overly long. For example, `hydraulic_conductivity` is a better field name than simply `K`. As of this writing, Landlab has not yet adopted a standard naming convention (such as the CSDMS Standard Names, or the CF Standard Names), but best practice is to follow the *de facto* Landlab standards for names that already exist in at least one component. Landlab has tended thus far to use names that are in the spirit of (and sometimes identical to) the CSDMS Standard Names, while keeping these names to a manageable length.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Public and Private Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The following describes an emerging coding standard for component class variables to be adopted starting with Landlab 2.0:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the Python convention that class variables are \"private\" if their name begins with an underscore, and \"public\" if it does not. For internal variables that are not intended to be viewed or modified by users, make the variable private by prepending an underscore. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`self._diffusivity = 0.01`\n",
    "\n",
    "For internal variables that you wish users to be able to read (only), make the internal variable private but provide a \"getter\" function that is tagged with the `@property` decorator. Example (from the Flexure component):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "@property\n",
    "def youngs(self):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Young's modulus of lithosphere (Pa).\"\"\"\n",
    "    return self._youngs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Including the \"getter\" function allows you to include documentation for the public variable in the form of a docstring.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want users to have both read and write access to a variable---for example, if you want a user to be able to dynamically change one of your parameters if needed---provide both a \"getter\" and a \"setter\". An example of a getter-setter pair is (also from Flexure):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "@property\n",
    "def eet(self):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Effective elastic thickness (m).\"\"\"\n",
    "    return self._eet\n",
    "\n",
    "@eet.setter\n",
    "def eet(self, new_val):\n",
    "    if new_val <= 0:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Effective elastic thickness must be positive.\")\n",
    "    self._eet = new_val\n",
    "    self._r = self._create_kei_func_grid(\n",
    "       self._grid.shape, (self.grid.dy, self.grid.dx), self.alpha\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a setter function allows you to make sure that the user isn't giving an inappropriate value of the parameter (as in the example of a negative elastic thickness above, which would not make any sense)."
