A key difference to what you may have seen before is that the inputs to the component are now fed in as *dynamic Python objects*, i.e., floats, strings, arrays, rather than being fed in as strings from a text input file (though note, you an still do this, see below). This has two major advantages: firstly, components now have plainly declared default values, that are visible just like they would be in, say, a numpy function; secondly, because the inputs are now Python objects, it's a lot easier to work with spatially variable inputs that need to be passed in as arrays, and also to feed dynamically changing inputs into a component.\n",

Note that nothing is returned from a run method like this, but that nonetheless *the grid fields are updated*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This `dt` is properly thought of as the *external model timestep*; it controls essentially the frequency at which the various Landlab components you're implementing can exchange information with each other and with the driver (e.g., frequency at which uplift steps are added to the grid). If your model has a stability condition which demands a shorter timestep, the external timestep will be subdivided internally down to this shorter timescale.\n",
